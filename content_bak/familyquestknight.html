    Family Quest Knight is our family friendly event. The goal
    of this event is to demonstrate a variety of family friendly
    boardgames, and a variety of house rules that can be applied
    to popular games to make them more appropriate for younger audiances.

    We want to see the board game industry, and the local gaming community
    grow. Not only passed down to future generations, but also to raise
    awareness outside of the existing community.
